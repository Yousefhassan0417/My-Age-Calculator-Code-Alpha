      <p>The age is something one person is proud of, while another tries to hide it from everyone. Traditionally, the age of a person is connected with his/her life experience, values, and wisdom. It is a known fact that our age is measured chronologically, but not everyone is aware of the fact that in different cultures age is calculated in different ways. I.e., some nations define a personâ€™s age starting from the day the person was born, and some consider a newborn baby being already 1 year old. In old-fashioned Chinese culture, the age of a person is calculated by their Traditional New Year defined by Traditional Chinese Lunar Year.</p>
